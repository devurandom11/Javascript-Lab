In the code, monica is an object that contains 2 properties and a function addToBalance. Find a way to use monica's `addToBalance` for object `rachel` without creating a new object. The function `rachelAddToBalance` should use object rachel and the constant variable fee that are already defined. When calling the following `rachelAddToBalance()`, it should return:

```cpp
 "Rachel Green remaining balance is 1700"
```

instead of

```cpp
'Monica Geller remaining balance is 500'
```

NOTE If you failed the tests and you uncommented the last lines in the code, you should remove or comment out the last lines again.
